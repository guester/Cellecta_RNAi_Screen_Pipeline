#This is a shell script designed to process sequencing data from genome-wide, RNAi-based negative selections screens
#using the Cellecta Human Modules shRNA screening library

#Run the 'trimbarcodes' script created by Jon Irish that uses Trimm-O-matic software to trim fastq.gz sequencing files
#down to a sequence length of 18.  Note that this step takes several hours to complete.

#unzip the trimmed files with gunzip
gunzip *trimmed.fastq.gz

#Run Deconvoluter software

#Take Output files from Deconvoluter and first concatenate the files for Lanes 1-3
#Using the Cellecat ID variable as a key, import the processed reads value for Lanes 4-6
#Calculate fold depletion by dividing initial timepoint processed reads(Lanes 1-3) by final timepoint processed reads(Lanes 4-6)
#Export a .csv file with 3 variables: Gene Symbol, Cellecta Id, Fold depletion
