#This is a shell script designed to process sequencing data from genome-wide, RNAi-based negative selections screens
#using the Cellecta Human Modules shRNA screening library

#Run the 'trimbarcodes' script created by Jon Irish that uses Trimm-O-matic software to trim fastq.gz sequencing files
#down to a sequence length of 18.  Note that this step takes several hours to complete.
